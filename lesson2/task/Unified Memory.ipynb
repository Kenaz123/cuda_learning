    "The [*CUDA Best Practices Guide*](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#memory-optimizations), a highly recommended followup to this and other CUDA fundamentals labs, recommends a design cycle called **APOD**: **A**ssess, **P**arallelize, **O**ptimize, **D**eploy. In short, APOD prescribes an iterative design process, where developers can apply incremental improvements to their accelerated application's performance, and ship their code. As developers become more competent CUDA programmers, more advanced optimization techniques can be applied to their accelerated code bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will support such a style of iterative development. You will be using the Nsight Systems command line tool **nsys** to qualitatively measure your application's performance, and to identify opportunities for optimization, after which you will apply incremental improvements before learning new techniques and repeating the cycle. As a point of focus, many of the techniques you will be learning and applying in this lab will deal with the specifics of how CUDA's **Unified Memory** works. Understanding Unified Memory behavior is a fundamental skill for CUDA developers, and serves as a prerequisite to many more advanced memory management techniques."

    "The only way to be assured that attempts at optimizing accelerated code bases are actually successful is to profile the application for quantitative information about the application's performance. `nsys` is the Nsight Systems command line tool. It ships with the CUDA toolkit, and is a powerful tool for profiling accelerated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nsys` is easy to use. Its most basic usage is to simply pass it the path to an executable compiled with `nvcc`. `nsys` will proceed to execute the application, after which it will print a summary output of the application's GPU activities, CUDA API calls, as well as information about **Unified Memory** activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When accelerating applications, or optimizing already-accelerated applications, take a scientific and iterative approach. Profile your application after making changes, take note, and record the implications of any refactoring on performance. Make these observations early and often: frequently, enough performance boost can be gained with little effort such that you can ship your accelerated application. Additionally, frequent profiling will teach you how specific changes to your CUDA code bases impact its actual performance: knowledge that is hard to acquire when only profiling after many kinds of changes in your code bases."
